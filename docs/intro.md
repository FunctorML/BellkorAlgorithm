Bellkor Algorithm
=================

Motivation
----------

Implement an Algorithm that had previously won a Data Science / well known competition, in this case the Netflix Grand Prize.

Bellkor Algorithm
-----------------

This is an implementation of the “BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos” final solution, which eventually went on to win the Netflix Grand Prize. The purpose of this algorithm is to recalibrate the ratings, [Feature Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering), to be more effective for when creating a Recommendation Engine.

Demo and usage
--------------

I've created a IPython Notebook [here](resources/Demo.ipynb) which showcases the implementation.

Acknowledgments
